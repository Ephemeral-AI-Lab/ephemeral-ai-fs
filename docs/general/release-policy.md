# LayerFS release policy

> **Status:** Current release policy.

LayerFS uses semantic versioning for the workspace packages and publishes one
immutable manual under `docs/versioned/<release>/` for each release.

## Release requirements

A release candidate is eligible only when:

- the workspace builds and all tests pass;
- formatting, warning-denying Clippy, and `git diff --check` pass;
- the public SDK and CLI reference match their exported surface;
- the SQLite schema and static SQL manifest pass their structural tests;
- supported FUSE and container-runtime gates pass on a capable host;
- the versioned manual and limitations are complete;
- every published benchmark links to reproducible raw evidence and identifies
  the exact source;
- the release tag resolves to the reviewed source tree.

## Version meaning

- A patch release within `0.1.x` preserves the documented public API, CLI,
  daemon protocol, canonical identity, and Store-format contract while
  correcting behavior or documentation.
- The 0.1.3 Developer Preview is an explicit exception to the
  earlier blanket Store-format promise: it migrates schema 4 to schema 5.
  Canonical identity remains unchanged, but migration is one-way and runtime
  components must be version-matched. The [0.1.3 release contract](../../release-notes/0.1.3/release-contract.md)
  defines the upgrade boundary; do not infer downgrade or mixed-version support.
- The owner-approved 0.1.4 Developer Preview is also an explicit Store-format exception: new Stores use schema 7, supported development schema 6 remains legacy, and released schema 5 is rejected without migration. Canonical identity is preserved. The [0.1.4 release contract](../../release-notes/0.1.4/release-contract.md) defines this boundary.
- The owner-authorized v0.1.5 Developer Preview is the current scoped
  canonical/Store-format exception: new Stores use **ordinary schema 10**
  storage (4 KiB pages, exact CAS, compression, bounded whole-file small
  content below 128 KiB, bounded delta chains, large-file CDC/extents, compact
  scoped namespaces and pooled metadata), while supported schema-6/7/8/9 Stores
  open without promotion. **Explicit compaction is removed by the 2026-09-11
  owner decision** — there is no compaction API or binary in this release, and
  previously compacted Stores remain readable through the retained
  authenticated LFCNT1 read path. Canonical identity is preserved. The
  [v0.1.5 specification](../roadmap/0.1/0.1.5/spec.md) and the
  [v0.1.5 release contract](../../release-notes/0.1.5/release-contract.md)
  define this boundary. Benchmark evidence below is single-sample campaign
  evidence, not a universal speed or storage guarantee.
- A pre-1.0 minor release such as `0.2.0` may define a revised public or
  storage contract and must document its compatibility boundary explicitly.
- A 1.0-or-later major release follows ordinary stable semantic-versioning
  expectations for incompatible public changes.

Pre-1.0 releases may evolve quickly. Any compatibility promise must still be
stated explicitly in that release's manual; silence is not a promise.

## Evidence policy

Performance claims must come from the released source or an exact recorded
source seal, use public operations, keep comparison boundaries matched, retain
every valid preregistered sample, and disclose setup excluded from timing.
Exploratory measurements may guide engineering but are not release claims.

All benchmark specifications, execution, evidence, and reporting must satisfy
the [LayerFS benchmark rules](benchmark_rules.md). An authenticity, timing,
family-completeness, memory-attribution, custody, or claim-mapping failure
blocks publication independently of numerical performance.

The v0.1.5 release reuses the complete #120 campaign rather than re-running it.
Targets the owner waived for v0.1.5 (unrelated-history 500 < 15 s, cold Init
2.7 s, Stage2 K10, and the K32000 historical-family reporting target) are
recorded as waivers with their exact measured values, scope, reason and residual
risk in [release-notes/0.1.5/waivers.md](../../release-notes/0.1.5/waivers.md).
A waiver retires that target for this release only; it does not convert the
measured result into a pass, and it does not lower the target for any other case
or for a future release.

The [0.1.2 benchmark report](../../release-notes/0.1.2/benchmark-results.md)
records complete SDK edit evidence and the release-source namespace/Store
refresh. Its explicitly approved tolerances and sampled-memory limitations are
part of the published claim, not strict-threshold passes. Earlier release
records remain immutable under `release-notes/`.
